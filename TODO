1. Concurrency model.
2. Some compelling examples
--> parser error handling
--> flowlet switching
--> actions need to be atomic
--> extern method calls need to be atomic.
3. Show that it's not a great change to the parser.
4. Compilation strategies for @atomic:
--> Move everything into a pipeline stage.
--> Coarse-grained locking.
--> Fine-grained locking.
5. The catch:
May have to reject code.
But that's going to happen now anyway:
--> Ternary operator may not be supported.
--> Long action bodies.
--> Complex expressions.

% 1. Nesting transactions: not supported.
% SQL supports it so that it can handle transactions within stored procedures
% https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189336(v=sql.105).aspx
% Here, either the stored procedure itself is a transaction or is called within a bigger transaction
% We can just rejected nested transactions and have the user un-nest statements into a nested transaction.

% 2. Mixing transactional and non-transactional code: not supported
% C++ has to support it because you may mix locking with transactional code
% https://3f993110-a-62cb3a1a-s-sites.googlegroups.com/site/tmforcplusplus/C%2B%2BTransactionalConstructs-1.1.pdf
% Haskell's composable transactions doesn't support it.
% http://community.haskell.org/~simonmar/papers/stm.pdf
% It isn't fundamental.

% 3. Exceptions in transactions: abort the code as though nothing happened.
% 4. Bigger structural problem with P4: exceptions aren't even supported.
% 5. Unstructed control flow: returns, exits
